# Read Local .json File and Output .txt File (Perl)
Just a reference for myself to refer back to when working on future Perl projects. Reads in local JSON file and outputs data in formatted TXT file.

# Setup
*To Run:*
  ```
  git clone https://github.com/brianhodges/perl-json2txt
  cd perl-json2txt
  perl main.pl
  ```
*Formatted log.txt file will output to the project root*
